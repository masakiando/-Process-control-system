Custom Pipe Implementation 
• Pipes are classes annotated with the @Injectable() decorator. 
• Pipes must implement the PipeTransform generic interface. Therefore, every pipe must have a transform() method. This method will be called by NestJS to process the arguments. 
• The transform() method accepts two parameters: 
    value: the value of the processed argument. metadata (optional): an object containing metadata about the argument. 
• Whatever is returned from the transform() method will be passed on to the 
    route handler. Exceptions will be sent back to the client. 
• Pipes can be consumed in different ways.
